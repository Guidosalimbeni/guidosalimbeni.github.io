        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>
          My research examines the evolution and impact of AI in contemporary
          art practices, investigating how artificial intelligence challenges
          and enhances our understanding of creativity. Through both theoretical
          analysis and practical experimentation, I explore the motivations
          driving artists to engage with AI technologies and develop frameworks
          for understanding this emerging field. Combining the research in AI
          technologies with my personal arstistic practice and professional
          projects.
