## **LEGAL & INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS**

### Copyright Ruling on AI Art

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., affirmed that a work of art generated by artificial intelligence without human input cannot be copyrighted under U.S. law. The decision involved Stephen Thaler's AI system "DABUS" and its artwork "A Recent Entrance to Paradise."

### Artist Protection Movements

Joy Cardaño, who goes by Joyblivion on Instagram, said commissioned anime-inspired art work has nearly come to a halt, with many online users seeming to gravitate toward artificial intelligence-made art instead. Artists are increasingly vocal about protecting their work from unauthorized AI training.

## **TECHNOLOGY TRENDS**

### AI Tools Evolution

In 2025, AI art is no longer new. It's part of how many people create. People use it for social media content, blog illustrations, presentations, game assets, and marketing materials. However, AI tools are not perfect. They often struggle with hands, text, or realistic faces.

### Acceptance and Integration

AI art is most accepted when it is used with care. Many smart creators are finding ways to mix AI with other tools, making the art feel more original and showing that the creator put in effort.

According to Artsy's Art Collector Insights 2024, 82% of collectors under the age of 37 said they had purchased art online. This group also grew up around technology, which is a key part of AI art's appeal.

## **DEBATE & DISCUSSION**

### The Human vs. Machine Question

Many artists are already using the inventions (and provocations) of AI in works of great substance, but of course the artists are still the ones bringing it into the room. The debate continues over whether AI can truly be creative or merely mimics human creativity through sophisticated pattern recognition.

### Future Implications

A UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report forecasts the global AI market will surge from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033, marking a 25-fold increase, suggesting massive growth potential for AI art markets.

## **LOOKING AHEAD**

As we move through 2025, the AI art landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Key questions remain: How will copyright laws adapt? Will traditional art institutions fully embrace AI art? And most importantly, how will the relationship between human creativity and artificial intelligence continue to develop?

The Christie's auction success suggests strong collector interest, while artist protests indicate ongoing concerns about fair compensation and creative integrity. The future likely lies in finding balance—leveraging AI's capabilities while respecting human artistry and ensuring ethical practices.
