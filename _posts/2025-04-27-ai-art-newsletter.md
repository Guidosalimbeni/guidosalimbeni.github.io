# AI Art Scene: April 2025 Highlights

The AI art landscape continues to evolve rapidly this month with major exhibitions, contests, and developments reshaping how we understand the intersection of technology and creativity. From comprehensive institutional surveys to innovative competitions, April 2025 offers abundant opportunities for artists working with artificial intelligence.

## Major Exhibitions Opening This Month

### Jeu de Paume Presents "The World According to AI" in Paris

The Jeu de Paume in Paris has launched a groundbreaking exhibition titled "Le Monde Selon L'IA" (The World According to AI), running from April 11 to September 21, 2025[^1]. This extensive survey brings together more than thirty artists actively involved with AI, including notable names such as Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, Grégory Chatonsky, Agnieszka Kurant, Christian Marclay, Trevor Paglen, and Hito Steyerl[^1]. As the first substantial institutional survey of this scope on art and AI, the exhibition offers a critical lens on social, environmental, and geopolitical phenomena while providing historical and genealogical analysis[^1].

The exhibition spans all floors of the museum and features works created using AI across various disciplines including visual arts, photography, music, film, and literature[^4]. Located at 1 place de la Concorde in the Tuileries Garden, the exhibition is open from 11am to 7pm daily (until 9pm on Tuesdays), with admission ranging from €7.50 to €12[^4]. This comprehensive showcase represents an important milestone in institutional recognition of AI's role in artistic creation.

### ADAF 2025 | SIMULACRA

Another notable event this month is ADAF 2025 | SIMULACRA, announced on April 3, 2025[^8]. While complete details are limited in the available information, this festival appears to focus on AI art and digital creation. The event is listed on the European Festivals Association platform, suggesting international significance in the digital arts community[^8].

## Contests and Calls for Submissions

### Expand and Contract 2025 – AI and Alternative Processes

The Los Angeles Center of Photography (LACP) is currently accepting submissions for its "Expand and Contract 2025 – AI and Alternative Processes" photography contest until April 17, 2025[^3]. This dual-format exhibition-virtual and in-person-aims to spark dialogue about AI's role in redefining visual storytelling, from image creation to post-processing[^3].

Participants can win cash prizes up to \$1,000 and exhibition opportunities, with the top three winners showcasing their work in LACP's Downtown LA gallery and online[^3]. The contest is open to photographers and artists of all levels working in any medium with a connection to photography, emphasizing creativity, originality, and technical quality[^3]. Winners will be notified by May 6, 2025, with a virtual opening reception scheduled for May 29 and an in-person exhibition opening on June 11 in Downtown LA[^3].

Entry fees range from \$25 for one image to \$200 for 31-35 images, with LACP members receiving a 50% discount[^3]. This contest represents an excellent opportunity for artists exploring the intersection of AI and photography to gain recognition and exposure.

### IEEE AIART Gallery 2025

The IEEE AIART Gallery 2025 is accepting submissions until April 30, 2025, for an international exhibition showcasing cutting-edge developments in AI-driven art[^6]. This exhibition, part of the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia \& Expo (ICME 2025), will take place from June 30 to July 4, 2025, in Nantes, France[^6].

The exhibition theme is "Intelligence Reimagined: The Convergence of Art and AI," and accepts both AI-generated or AI-assisted artworks and artworks on AI themes[^6]. Accepted formats include paintings, graphic design, installations, interactive art, video, animation, music, audio, and literature[^6]. Selected works will be featured in the on-site exhibition at La Cité des Congrès de Nantes and included in the official booklet[^6]. This represents a significant opportunity for artists to engage with the academic and research community at the forefront of multimedia and AI development.

### IJCAI 2025 Art Gallery Call for Artworks

The International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) 2025 is calling for submissions to its Art Gallery under the theme "Machine Sovereignty and Digital Mortality"[^2]. The exhibition seeks groundbreaking artworks that explore the paradox of machine agency and transience in our hybrid physical-digital world[^2].

All submissions must incorporate AI in their creation process-whether through AI generative tools, AI-assisted techniques, or by featuring AI or robotics as integral components[^2]. The organizers encourage participants to draw inspiration from prior IJCAI research and innovations, creating works that challenge perceptions of machines, humanity, and digital existence[^2]. While the specific April deadline isn't mentioned, this represents an ongoing opportunity for artists working with AI to showcase their work at a prestigious international conference.

## Industry Insights

### AI Generative Art in 2025: Moving Beyond Novelty

A recent analysis published on April 24, 2025, explores how AI generative art has evolved past its initial "honeymoon phase"[^7]. The article discusses how the field has matured from the initial excitement of tools like Midjourney and DALL·E to more nuanced questions about integration, collaboration, and ethical considerations[^7].

The piece notes that Midjourney in particular has seen explosive growth, expanding from 1 million users to over 20 million by late 2024, with added personalization features that allow users to develop a rapport with the AI[^7]. The industry now faces significant questions about payment, originality in a remix culture, and finding balanced approaches in an increasingly polarized landscape[^7]. This reflection captures the current state of AI art as it transitions "from toys to power tools" and grapples with its place in the broader creative ecosystem.

## Conclusion

April 2025 represents a vibrant moment in the evolution of AI art, with major institutional validation through exhibitions like Jeu de Paume's comprehensive survey, alongside numerous opportunities for artists to submit their work to contests and exhibitions worldwide. As the field matures, questions of ethics, integration, and originality become increasingly prominent, suggesting that AI art is moving beyond novelty toward more sophisticated creative and philosophical engagement. For artists and enthusiasts in this space, the coming months promise continued growth, debate, and innovation at the intersection of artificial intelligence and artistic expression.
