# AI Art Newsletter - January 31, 2025

## Breaking News: US Copyright Office Updates AI Art Policy

A significant shift has occurred in the U.S. Copyright Office's stance on AI-assisted artwork. The new policy establishes that while AI-generated art can now receive copyright protection, creators must demonstrate substantial human creative input. This balanced approach acknowledges both technological advancement and human creativity.

Key points from the policy update:

- AI art lacking direct human creative expression cannot receive copyright protection
- Human authorship remains essential for protection
- AI is positioned as a tool rather than an autonomous creator
- Guidelines emphasize the importance of documenting human creative input
